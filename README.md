# Calculator

my expectation for the final calculator project:

1. do basic arithmetics(+,-,*,/ and using 括号);
2. do algrbraic calculations (i.e. those with unknown $x$)
3. numerically solve equations
4. numerically do differentiation and integration base on 2.
5. (may be too naive) analytically do differentiation and integration.
6. (may be too naive) numerically solve diffentiatial equation.
